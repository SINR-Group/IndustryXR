## Title
Integrated cyber-physical systems and industrial metaverse for remote manufacturing

## Summary
It discusses the use of metaverse for smart manufacturing systems. Its purpose could be repairs/maintenace, starting new manufacturing lines, remote monitoring/troubleshooting, remote control and new user/manager training through simulation.

The advantages are limitless but can be decreasing scrape and rework, reducing unscheduled downtime , reducing compliance costs, increasing throughput and improving training.

- It can offer realtime training and reduce training costs.
- it can develop a sense of spacial presence and increase usability
- experts can directly interact with machine in real-time by multiple suers

some metrics have been mentioned including time for training, knowledge retension, time to fix problem, downtime reduction and cost.
