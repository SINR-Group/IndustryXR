## Title
Towards Metaverse: Utilizing Extended Reality and Digital Twins to Control Robotic Systems

## Summary
The paper talks about usecases of integrating Virrtual Reality and Digital Twins. It talks about requrements - functional and non functional requirements (Performance, Cyber Security etc).
It covers the use of Digital Twins, XR and Metaverse in 4 cases :

1. Probot’s Extended-Reality Interface for Future Industrial Robotics - operating a mobile robot in VR and movement with custom designed gloves. Operating the robot in 2 modes. ghost control (user sets the position and robot follows that) and direct control (robot follows in real time)
2. FIU’s Robotics Testbed for Teleoperation in Environments with Sensing and
Communication Challenges - Robot teleoperation using VR for underwater ROVs
3. Centria’s Extended Reality as a Robotic Training Tool
4. TUAS VR Social Platform
